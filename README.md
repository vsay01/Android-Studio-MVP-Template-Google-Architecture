# Android-Studio-MVP-Template-Google-Architecture

Starting with Android Studio 4.1, Google ended its support for custom FreeMarker templates. :( 
Now you can’t just write your FTL files and put them in a template folder of Android Studio

> **For Android Studio 4.1**: You can install this plugin write plugin as follow: https://github.com/vsay01/Android-Studio-MVP-Template-Google-Architecture-Plugin. Generate jar file and install plugin locally.

## Updated
I added support for Kotlin, so there are two templates:
- MVP Template Google Architect (Java)
- MVP Template Google Architect (Kotlin)

If you install manually and interested in Kotlin only, you need to copy folder MVP Template Google Architect (Kotlin) otherwise if you install via the script install.sh then both template should be available for you.

One important thing to note is that you need to select source language for each template (Please refer to demo). In other word:
- If you choose MVP Template Google Architect (Java) template → source language need to be Java
- If you choose MVP Template Google Architect (Kotlin) template → source language need to be Kotlin

======================================================================================

This is an Android Studio template for MVP; the template is inspired by [google samples/ android architecture](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp/)

`Important`: The main goal of this template is to speed up the development process using android mvp template. This is just a template, so feel free to make changes according to your needs. It also shows how to create a set of files using template files in Android Studio. This template was successfully tested with Android 2.3.3.

Thanks to [riggaroo/android-studio-group-templates-mvp](https://github.com/riggaroo/android-studio-group-templates-mvp) and [benoitletondor/Android-Studio-MVP-template](https://github.com/benoitletondor/Android-Studio-MVP-template) for the resources allow me create my own.

## Installation

#### For Mac:

- If you have a standard Android Studio installation:

Just run the install script at the root of this repository:

```
./install.sh
```

- Manual installation:

Just copy directory `MVPTemplate` to `$ANDROID_STUDIO_FOLDER$/Contents/plugins/android/lib/templates/activities/`

#### For Windows:

Just copy directory `MVPTemplate` to `$ANDROID_STUDIO_FOLDER$\plugins\android\lib\templates\activities\`

## How to use

#### 1. Create Base classes

The main idea of the base classes is to have common methods that share across the activities, fragments, contracts and presenters, written down in one place.

For instance: In our MVP template, all views will need to set the presenter so wrote a  method, setPresenter(), in the BasePresenter so all the presenters class inherite from BasePresenter need to implement the method.

Here are the needed bases classes:

- BaseActivity
```
package com.template.test.testmvptemplate; // your application package

import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;

public abstract class BaseActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
  // TODO: add any relevance methods
}
```

- BaseFragment
```
package com.template.test.testmvptemplate; // your application package

import android.support.v4.app.Fragment;

public class BaseFragment extends Fragment {
  // TODO: add any relevance methods
}

```

- BaseContract
```
package com.template.test.testmvptemplate; // your application package

public interface BaseContract {

  interface View<T extends Presenter> {
    void setPresenter(T presenter);
  }

  interface Presenter {
    void start();
    void stop();
  }
}
```

- BasePresenter
```
package com.template.test.testmvptemplate; // your application package

import android.content.Context;
import android.support.annotation.NonNull;

public class BasePresenter {
  protected Context mContext;

  public void subscribe(@NonNull Context context) {
    this.mContext = context;

  public boolean isSubscribed() {
    return mContext != null;
  }
}
```
#### 2. Generate MVP template
![Create MVP template](demo/createmvpdemo.gif "Create MVP template")

#### 3. Resolve imports and add your activities to manifest
Import classes as needed. and currently this template doesnot add the created activity to manifest.xml, so you need to manually add your activity to manifest.xlm file.

## Known issue
From [Riggaroo blog/ known issue for MVP template](https://riggaroo.co.za/custom-file-template-group-android-studiointellij/):
`When upgrading Android Studio, and you have custom groups of file templates in the installation area specified above, Studio will say you have conflicts in the area that need to be deleted. Unfortunately you will have to remove them, and then place them in the same folder after the upgrade.` [Check out this feature request here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37105193).
